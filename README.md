<h2># PyMine is server software for Minecraft: PocketEdition.</h2>
<p>This software is based on <a href="https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP">PocketMine-MP</a></p>
<p>Most of the original code was written by <b>PocketMine Team</b>.</p>
<p>Part of the code was written by <b>ClearSkyTeam</b> and <b>BlueLightJapan</b>
<p>And I try to convert it to Python :)) - it still building, so, it not run and nothing to run =))</p>
